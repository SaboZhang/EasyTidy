EasyTidy is a powerful file management software. It can automatically process and organize files and folders, leaving your file system in an orderly manner. Features include: Powerful file filtering: You can filter files by file name, directory, size, date, attributes, content or regular expressions to accurately locate the files you need. Flexible execution mode: Supports manual operation and automatic execution. In terms of automatic execution, you can set a delay start, or you can execute it at fixed intervals, and you can also customize the execution cycle through the CRON expression to meet the file management needs in different scenarios.Open source and free

If you find that DropIT's task monitoring doesn't meet your needs, or the price of File Juggler 3 is not quite suitable, you can give EasyTidy a try. EasyTidy is currently under active development, and we welcome your suggestions. Reasonable feature requests will be considered and accepted.
