Features include: Powerful file filtering: You can filter files by file name, directory, size, date, attributes, content or regular expressions to accurately locate the files you need.

If you find that DropIT's task monitoring doesn't meet your needs, or the price of File Juggler 3 is not quite suitable, you can give EasyTidy a try. EasyTidy is currently under active development, and we welcome your suggestions. Reasonable feature requests will be considered and accepted.
